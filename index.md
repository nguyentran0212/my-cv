## Research overview

I am a research fellow at CREST, University of Adelaide, leading work that blends blockchain, software‑supply‑chain security, distributed ML operations, and LLM‑based systems.  Key achievements include a DSTG‑partnered edge‑blockchain platform, a metadata‑management architecture to mitigate supply‑chain attacks, and a secure, provenance‑aware MLOps framework.  Currently I develop *Skel*, a lightweight LLM‑agent framework, and investigate trust‑worthy architectures for autonomous workflows.

### Research interests
- Blockchain & edge deployment  
- Software‑supply‑chain architecture & metadata  
- Distributed ML operations & provenance  
- LLM‑based multi‑agent systems

## Selected Projects
`2024`  
**Skel** – Lightweight and extensible framework for LLM‑based multi‑agent systems.  Skel provides a low‑abstraction, easy‑to‑understand architecture that allows researchers and educators to prototype multi‑agent workflows using LLMs as the backend, while simultaneously evolving toward production‑ready deployments.

`2023`  
**NVAL** – Blockchain network deployment & evaluation framework.  NVAL is an architecture‑driven, extensible automation tool that facilitates reproducible research on blockchain design decisions and enables “blockchain‑as‑a‑service” for production use cases.

`2023`  
**DDRI** – Decentralised platform based on an ad‑hoc edge blockchain.  DDRI supports trustworthy, resilient information maintenance and updates at the edge, and is designed for extensibility to future applications and use cases.
