## Currently
Research fellow the Centre for Research on Engineering Software Technology ([CREST](https://www.crest-centre.net)) at the University of Adelaide, conducting research in the [TIPS](http://dlt.crest-centre.net). My core research question is how to empower organisations and individuals to build and use *decentralised software solutions that are efficient, resilient, secure, privacy-preserving, and user‑controllable.* My research adopts an engineering‑centric approach, focusing on the systemisation of architectural design knowledge and the development of tools and frameworks to enable decentralised software.
